Android Malware detection with machine learning
===
This repository contains scripts to predict whether an unlabelled Android app observation is malware or benignware.
The feature extraction part can be accessed at
[https://github.com/aaronkaplan/33onethird](https://github.com/aaronkaplan/33onethird).

Setup
---
### Environment setup
We used Debian machines for our experiments.

Prerequisites for the scripts is a valid Python 3 installation, ie.
```
sudo apt install python3
```
The training script also needs the `python3-tk` package:
```
sudo apt install python3-tk
```
Now clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/33onethird/malware-test
cd malware-test
```
Next, install the python packages as listed in `requirements.txt`. You might want to use a
[`virtualenv`](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) for that.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Data preparation
To setup the training environment, you need to run the data preparation scripts (`acc_features.py` and `gen_vectors.py`)
first.

#### `acc_features`
The observation data should be the output of the [feature extraction](https://github.com/aaronkaplan/33onethird), ie
text files with string identfiers. Put all observation data into a directory. Then run `acc_features.py` with this
directory as input.
```
./acc_features.py -i [observation_directory]
```
It will use the directory `feature-vectors` as default. If you create such a directory in the repository root, you can
run:
```
./acc_features.py
```

You can also specify the output directory of `acc_features.py`. For further information, run:
```
./acc_features.py -h
```

#### `gen_vectors`
After `acc_features.py` has omitted all features, you need to run `gen_vectors.py`. It will create binary vectors out of
the observation text files. You need to specify the path to the feature file (output of `acc_features.py`) and the
observation data directory (should be the same as in `acc_features.py`).

You also need to provide a `csv` file that
identifies all malware observations. It needs to contain the id (filename) of each malware observation in the first row.
The rest of the file's content is ignored.

__Important__: Since there is a large number of high dimensional observations, `gen_vectors.py` cannot store all of them
in memory. Therefore, it will process them in batches and omit an output file for each batch. You need to specify the
number of observations per batch. By default, it will process batches of 1000 observations, which uses around 2.5 GB of
memory. Adjust this number according to your memory constraints.

You can also specify the output directory of `gen_vectors.py`.

For more information, run:
```
./gen_vectors.py -h
```

Usage
---
After everything has been set up, you can fit Machine Learning models onto the training data. This step is 
straightforward. Just call `epxeriments.py` and specify the ML algorithm, eg.
```
./experiments.py -a svm
```
The script will output the model performance and dump the learned parameters.
